# QQScrape

## Overview

QQScrape is a web scraping and data visualization tool designed to extract, analyze, and present music chart data from QQMusic. It consists of a backend scraper and a web application that provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the collected data.

## How It Works

QQScrape is built with two primary components:

1. **Backend Scraper**

   - Utilizes **[Rain120's QQMusic API](https://github.com/Rain120/qq-music-api)** for efficient data retrieval. 
        - Special thanks to Rain120 for developing this, as I found no other working APIs available in the US.
   - Uses web scraping techniques to extract song rankings, metadata, and streaming statistics.
   - Stores data in a structured format for further analysis.

2. **Web Application**

   - Developed using **Next.js** and **Supabase** to display real-time and historical chart data.
   - Features an interactive dashboard where users can explore ranking trends, song longevity, and comparative analysis.
   - Implements search and filtering functionalities to easily navigate large datasets.
   - Uses **Recharts** for data visualization, enabling users to view trends over time.

### Data Collection

- Fetches chart listings and identifies song metadata, including title, artist, ranking, and stream count (if available), using Rain120's QQMusic API.
- Collects data at regular intervals to monitor ranking fluctuations over time.
- Ensures consistency in extracted metadata for accurate tracking and analysis.

### Data Processing

- **Validation & Normalization:** Cleans extracted data to maintain consistency across different chart formats.
- **Duplicate Handling:** Detects and removes redundant entries to prevent unnecessary data storage.
- **Historical Data Archiving:** Stores past chart data for long-term comparison and trend analysis.
- **Database Storage:** Uses PostgreSQL via Supabase for efficient querying and retrieval.
- **Caching Mechanism:** Optimizes API calls by storing and reusing previously retrieved song metadata, reducing redundant requests.

### Analysis & Insights

- **Ranking Trends:** Tracks song movement over time to identify emerging trends in the QQMusic ecosystem.
- **Longevity Analysis:** Measures how long a song remains in the charts and its ranking trajectory.
- **Breakout Detection:** Identifies rapidly rising tracks gaining popularity.
- **Performance Summaries:** Highlights the most stable, fastest-rising, and longest-lasting songs.
- **Chart Comparisons:** Compares ranking fluctuations across multiple QQMusic charts to determine crossover success.
- **API Access:** Provides structured API endpoints for seamless integration with OVG! Mediaâ€™s proprietary systems.

## Purpose

QQScrape is developed exclusively for **[OVG! Media](https://www.ovgmedia.com/)** as a proprietary tool. By automating data collection and providing structured insights, QQScrape streamlines QQMusic chart tracking and analysis for OVG! Media.
